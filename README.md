# fullcycle-docker-course-go-challenge
Implementation of a challenge using Docker and Go, referring to the completion of the Docker course, done on the FullCycle platform.

## Challenge description

This challenge is very exciting especially if you have never worked with the Go language!

You will have to publish an image to docker hub. When we run:

```
docker run <your-user>/fullcycle
```
We must have the following result: Full Cycle Rocks!!

If you notice, this image just prints the message as a final result, so it's worth checking out the Go Lang 

website to learn how to say "hello world".

Remembering that Go Lang has ready-made official images, it is worth consulting the Docker Hub.

Our Go project image needs to be less than 2MB =)

Tip: In the introduction video about Docker when we talk about the layered file system, I present a "root" image, maybe it's a good idea to use it.

Upload the project to a remote Git repository and link the image you uploaded to Docker Hub.

## Challenge answer
